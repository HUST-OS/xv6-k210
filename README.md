## Dependencies
+ `k210 board` or `qemu-system-riscv64`
+ RISC-V Toolchain: [riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HUST-OS/xv6-k210
```

## Build
First you need to connect your k210 board to your PC.  
And check the `USB serial port`:  
```bash
ls /dev/ | grep USB
```
In my situation it will be `ttyUSB0`  

```bash
cd xv6-k210
make build
```

## Run on k210 board
Instead of the original file system, xv6-k210 runs with FAT32. You might need an SD card with FAT32 format.  
To start `shell`, you need to rename the "_init" and "_sh" in the "/xv6-user" to "init" and "sh" after building, 
then copy them to the root of your SD card.  
Also, you can copy other programs start with "\_". 
Or you can directly run the command as below with your SD card connected to your PC (SD card reader required).

Warning: this will format your SD card and clean your original data!
```bash
make sdcard sd="your SD card device's path"
```

To run on k210:
```bash
make run
```

Sometimes you should change the `USB serial port`:  
```bash
make run k210-serialport=`Your-USB-port`(default by ttyUSB0)
```
Ps: Most of the k210-port in Linux is ttyUSB0, if you use Windows or Mac OS, this doc 
may help you: [maixpy-doc](https://maixpy.sipeed.com/zh/get_started/env_install_driver.html#)  

## Run on qemu-system-riscv64
First, make sure `qemu-system-riscv64` is installed on your system.  
Second, make a disk image file with FAT32 file system.
```bash
make fs
```
It will generate a disk image file `fs.img`, and compile some user programs like `shell` then copy them into the `fs.img`.  
As long as the `fs.img` exists, you don't need to do this every time before running, unless you want to update it.

Finally, start running.
```bash
make run platform=qemu
```

Ps: Press Ctrl + A then X to quit qemu.

## About shell

The shell commands are user programs, too. Those program should be put in a "/bin" directory in your SD card or the `fs.img`.  
Now we support a few useful commands, such as `cd`, `ls`, `cat` and so on.

In addition, `shell` supports some shortcut keys as below:

- Ctrl-H -- backspace  
- Ctrl-U -- kill a line  
- Ctrl-D -- end of file (EOF)  
- Ctrl-P -- print process list  

## Add my programs on xv6-k210
1. Make a new C source file in `xv6-user/` like `myprog.c`, and put your codes;
2. You can include `user.h` to use the functions declared in it, such as `open`, `gets` and `printf`;
3. Add a line "`$U/_myprog\`" in `Makefile` as below:
    ```Makefile
    UPROGS=\
        $U/_init\
        $U/_sh\
        $U/_cat\
        ...
        $U/_myprog\      # Don't ignore the leading '_'
    ```
4. Then make:
    ```bash
    make userprogs
    ```
    Now you might see `_myprog` in `xv6-user/` if no error detected. Finally you need to copy it into your SD (see [here](#run-on-k210-board))
     or FS image (see [here](#run-on-qemu-system-riscv64)).
